This is a R package created as a group project for DSCI_524 Collaborative Software Development of UBC Master of Data Science (MDS) program 2022-2023. Based on the foreign exchange data in Yahoo Finance, this package allows user to perform currency conversion based on the latest available exchange rate, lookup a target exchange rate from historical data as well plotting exchange rate history and profit/loss percentage history by specifying a currency pair (and other input parameters).

## Functions Description

-   `fx_conversion` Convert the input amount of currency 1 to currency 2 based on the latest available exchange rate.
-   `fx_rate_lookup` Lookup for the date of the first occurence (in reverse chronological order) on which the input target rate of a currency pair is within the day's high/low.
-   `price_trend_viz` Plot the historical exchange rate of the input currency pair for a specific period of time.
-   `pl_trend_viz` Plot the historical profit/loss percentage of the input currency pair for a specific period of time.

There is a R package [czechrates](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/czechrates/index.html) relevant to foreign exchange. The package only provides foreign exchange rates from Koruna to other currencies. It does not support global currency exchange rates and visualizations like `fxtrackerR` does.

## Installation

You can install the development version of fxtrackerR from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("UBC-MDS/fxtrackerR")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(fxtrackerR)
```

### To convert a specific amount of money from current currency (curr1) to desired currency (curr2):

    fx_conversion('EUR', 'USD', 150.75)

163.68

### To look up the first date (reverse chronological order) on which the target price falling between day high and day low based on the availability of data:

    fx_rate_lookup('EURUSD', 1.072)

'2023-01-10'

### To visualize the trend of the exchange rate of a currency pair between the selected start date and end date:

    price_trend_viz('EURUSD', '2018-12-01', '2022-12-01', 'high')

![](../man/figures/price_trend_viz.png)

### To visualize the trend of the profit and loss of a currency pair between the selected start date and end date:

**If a line chart is specified in the input:**

    pl_trend_viz("EURUSD", "2020-01-01", "2022-01-01", 'line')  

![](../man/figures/pl_trend_viz_line.png)

**If an area chart is specified in the input:**

    pl_trend_viz("EURUSD", "2020-01-01", "2022-01-01", 'area')
